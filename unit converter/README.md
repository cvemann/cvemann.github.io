# Unit Converter

This is a Solo project from my Learn Javascript course on Scrimba.

I wrote the html and styled it with CSS. The most important task was figuring out the conversion logic and rounding it up to 3 decimal places, then finally stringing it with the UI so it works.

You can try it out yourself.
